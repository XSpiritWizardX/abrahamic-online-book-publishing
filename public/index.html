Create `public/books.json` with a starter catalog (title, author, genre, blurb, cover image URL). Update the `#catalog` section in `public/index.html` with filter controls (select for genre + text input for search) and a container for cards. In `public/script.js`, fetch the JSON, render cards, wire filter/search to re-render, and add an empty-state message. Add matching card and control styles in `public/styles.css`.
